# Welcome to Kokebok!

This is the template for a custom site I created for a local bakery. We did not want it to be easily confused with other sites for buying and selling products, but rather to maintain a focus on food, and that the products can be well seen.


# Technologies
For the project I mainly used React Js, together with several libraries such as React Router, Bootstrap, sweetAlert, Firestore, among others.
